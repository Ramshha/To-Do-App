# To-Do-App
The To-Do List Application is a full-stack project built with React on the front-end and Express.js on the back-end. The application allows users to manage their tasks by adding, toggling the completion status, and deleting to-do items. It features a simple and intuitive interface and uses an in-memory storage solution for to-do items.
